TODO
gameplay
- rotational momentum, off-center collisions causing spinning
    - simple rigid attachments?
- collisions wrong for inelastic collisions, restitution ~= 0
- follow camera
- zoom camera based on speed and how far apart multiple players are
- large world
- minimap?
- acceleration arrows? >>

- AI opponents? hard
- different restitution amount for certain collisions? high restitution bumpers? certain moves from characters with tiny restitution? zero restitution?

graphics

theme
- bumper cars style gameplay
- space? overdone
- sumo? maybe

player physics
- proper linear interpolation for acceleration?
