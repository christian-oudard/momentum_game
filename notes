- ramp-up for turning rate

code
1 - have a real dispatch instead of isinstance BS
2 - remove singleton BS. we need to erect a correct flow of information between the various pieces for this though. global singletons are a very lazy and tangled way to avoid the issue.
- rename particle to entity or something

bugs
- fix extreme speed allowing particles to pass through walls.
- fix wall endpoints piercing through particles. to happen, it must be moving diagonally toward the point, but with the center moving away from the line of the wall.
