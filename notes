3 - rudder effect for steering
    rudder friction and rudder quality tunable parameters. 0.0 friction and infinite quality is a perfect frictionless rudder that converts every bit of energy to the correct direction instantly, with no loss. Higher friction parameters slow down the ship in the direction across the rudder. Lower quality parameters let some "water" through, converting just some of the energy into the correct direction per second.Maybe have to vary friction with the attack angle, so that high speed against rudder almost flat doesn't freak out. 
    - Is there a way to make the rudder single-direction so it doesn't run backward?


code
1 - have a real dispatch instead of isinstance BS
2 - remove singleton BS. we need to erect a correct flow of information between the various pieces for this though. global singletons are a very lazy and tangled way to avoid the issue.
- rename particle to entity or something

bugs
- fix extreme speed allowing particles to pass through walls.
- fix wall endpoints piercing through particles. to happen, it must be moving
  diagonally toward the point, but with the center moving away from the line of
  the wall.
