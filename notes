TODO
gameplay
2 - boost
    - extreme temporary explosive accelleration is FUN
	- charge up and explode forward, with increased mass
    - triggers when braking for more than a timeout while stopped.
    - gets more powerful the longer you hold it, up to a limit.
3 - follow camera
4 - zoom camera based on speed and how far apart multiple players are
5 - large world
- minimap?
- acceleration arrows? >>
- take damage when crashing into walls?

- AI opponents? hard
- different restitution amount for certain collisions? high restitution bumpers? certain moves from characters with tiny restitution? zero restitution?

graphics
1 - temporary graphics state to show turning, thrusting, braking, and boosting
theme
- bumper cars style gameplay
- space? overdone
- sumo? maybe

player physics
- proper linear interpolation for acceleration?
