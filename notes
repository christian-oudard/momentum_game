TODO
- remove singleton BS. we need to erect a correct flow of information between the various pieces for this though. global singletons are a very lazy and tangled way to avoid the issue.
- rename particle to entity or something
- fix extreme speed allowing particles to pass through walls.
- fix wall endpoints piercing through particles. to happen, it must be moving
  diagonally toward the point, but with the center moving away from the line of
  the wall.

x joystick which handles left/right stacking properly

start with momentum like subspace / cosmic rift

- player with direction
- add hard steering like ecco the dolphin

- maybe do separate braking versus thrusting curves?
    maybe have to do an absolute value thing so we don't allow backing up really fast at high speeds?
    cases:
    - when stationary, easy to start quickly.
    - when going fast forward, easy to stop, hard to go faster.
